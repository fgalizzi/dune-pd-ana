Average.cpp
Code to plot some waveforms (or compare the ones from different channels),
compute the average and disply the persistence plot. 

Avg_muon.cpp
Read wfs, subtract the baseline, plot the Fprompt-plot
(prompt_integral/integral) to select muon wfs and save them in a file.

DecoExt.cpp
Deconvolve wfs through the Wiener filter

LED_Analysis.cpp
Compute the charge histogram for a LED run and the Cross-talk probability

FFT_Comp.cpp
Plot N-vector on the same TGraph

Noise_PSD.cpp
Read noise.dat fils, compute the power spectral density for each wf and write
the average in a file

MAX_Analysis.cpp
Useful to plot couple of quantities of the waveforms (eg. charve vs max
amplitude)

WF_FFT.cpp
Plot the TH2D graph of the PSD of some WF (They could be all the one in a file or just a selection)
